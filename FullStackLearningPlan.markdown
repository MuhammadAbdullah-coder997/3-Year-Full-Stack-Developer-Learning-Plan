# 3-Year Full-Stack Developer Learning Plan

## Introduction
This 3-year plan transforms you into a proficient full-stack developer through six 6-month milestones, each focusing on specific technologies and skills. With ~20 hours per week of deliberate study and practice, you'll master frontend, backend, mobile, infrastructure, databases, and collaboration tools. You'll build a public portfolio webpage to showcase your work and complete capstone projects integrating all skills. As your mentor, I'll provide weekly check-ins, tips to avoid burnout, and guidance to adapt if you fall behind.
